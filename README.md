# Bike Project with the application of queues' models.
Run trajectory simulations by distributing bicycles between different stations, compute the empirical probability that the station is empty after 150h, estimate the confidence interval in the approximation of the central limit theorem, and consider that the probability law that gives the average number of empty stations follows a normal distribution. Determination of the relations between the stationary probability coefficients.  How many states are there in the state space if there is only one bicycle? In the case where there is only one bike, what are the probabilities for each station to be empty? Comparison of theoretical mathematical results to simulation, Simulation with 100 bikes, uniformly distributed.
